# PAIRS

This repositaty contains the code and trained models for our WACV 2019 paper: "Aligned to the Object, not to the Image: A Unified Pose-aligned Representation for Fine-grained Recognition". It contains three major parts: 1. pose estimation network, 2. patch feature extractors, and 3. classification network. The later two parts are in the process of final cleaning and will be available soon.

## Pose Estimation Network

We have two sub-modules for pose estimation frametwork. One is written in Torch (Lua) with ResNet-50 as back-bone network. The other is written in Pytorch (Python) with ResNet-34 as back-bone network.
